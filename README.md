## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hi there! My name is Paul Rukwaro and I'm a Software Engineer. I'm passionate about any Software related topic and love to work on projects that involve offering solutions to business.

I have experience in Python, C/C++, Javascript, SQL, NoSQL, and other technologies and have contributed to a number of projects in the past. Currently, I'm focused on expanding my skill base and am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.

Feel free to take a look at my repositories to see some of the projects I've worked on. If you have any questions or just want to connect, don't hesitate to reach out!

Thanks for stopping by.
